            <button class="dropdown-btn" data-target="faq2">I have an alarm system. What do I do on days my house is cleaned?</button>
            <div class="dropdown-content" id="faq2">
                <ul>
                    <li>If your home has a security system, please provide us with the code and steps necessary for us to turn off the alarm. We will reset the alarm when we leave. Alternatively, you may want to disable it on the day of your scheduled clean.</li>

            <button class="dropdown-btn" data-target="faq3">Will my house be inspected after every clean?</button>
            <div class="dropdown-content" id="faq3">
                <ul>
                    <li>Our Quality Control Inspectors inspect our teams on a regular basis. They may enter your home after the team leaves. The Cleaning Authority does these inspections to ensure the highest quality standards for our house cleaning services.</li>

            <button class="dropdown-btn" data-target="faq4">How much does house cleaning cost?</button>
            <div class="dropdown-content" id="faq4">
                <ul>
                    <li>The price of your home cleaning will vary based on several factors, including the size of the area to be cleaned, the frequency of cleaning visits, the condition of the space, the unique features of your home, the materials required, and even the presence of pets!</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Cleaning removes debris like dirt and dust from surfaces. This usually comes in the form of dusting, vacuuming, and mopping. Sanitizing is removing germs and bacteria from surfaces using sanitizing products. A surface can be cleaned without being sanitized.</li>
