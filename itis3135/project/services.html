              <ul>
                <li>When you sign up for regularly scheduled cleanings, we will first perform two deep cleanings. This is the kickoff to our Detail-Clean Rotation System, where we divide your rooms into four zones: bathroom, sleeping area, living area, and kitchen. In these initial detail cleanings, we will focus on two zones in each.
                    <ul>
                        <li>First deep clean - A Detail-Clean of your kitchen and bathrooms with a thorough cleaning of your living and sleeping areas.</li>
